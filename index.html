                My name is AJ Penalosa and I am a Web Designer living in the beautiful city of Los Angeles, CA.
                I have been designing, developing and maintaining websites since 2005.
                All websites are custom built with the user in mind to ensure that visitors have a positive and lasting experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I completed a three year program at Westwood College of Technology.
                I graduated in July of 2006 and received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Animation.
                The Animation program at Westwood College covered all aspects of design.
                I was exposed not only to 3D modeling and animation, but also to web design and print media.
                This broad range of experience helped me obtain a job as an in-house web designer for a local camera store.
                I worked there for three years and quickly grew a passion for web design.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2007, I decided I needed a change of pace.
                Having lived in Los Angeles my whole life, I wanted to experience life “away from home”.
                I was fresh out of college with a Bachelors Degree, so I figured it was the perfect opportunity.
                Las Vegas was a booming city, so I saw it as the best place to start off.
                I landed a job working full-time as a web designer for one of the leading companies in automotive online marketing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fast forward to 2017 and I find myself back in Los Angeles, focusing 100% on Pixel Motives.
                The software I use are Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Animate and Coda 2 by Panic Inc.
